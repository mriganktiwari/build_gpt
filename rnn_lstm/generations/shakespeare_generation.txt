BAPTISTA:

BIONDELLO:

To even a jick root and greson call'd Hortensio.

Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,

Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:

Here is my hand, and here I firmly voils
Than the fair is Hortensio: I say he jist time to get
A man cusing wish ry with of my father,

Would I am, to and went to her fully instruct,
And cut that your worship is deceived; the gown is made
Just as my master dowrith;

And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO:

Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.

Of with out of the fashion; for thou sakes it from
And greet once of her possecking coverno, in heart
Of your every, sir; and therefore leave I wish

BIANCA:

Servant:
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
You know to-kon, a wonders and so, and tell the meat.
What dogs are these! There is roary.

And stimcates the man-chapp'rd rack;
And, as my sparing in the witdess,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous with
Rich garments witness of all the world?

And venture madly on a desperate mart.

Fie doth latter gone on that I love thee well,
Ot it heard of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
A dish that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO:

KATHARINA:
Why! I tell they, good nimble, what of that?

CURTIS:
There is afreasing God I not him? Nay, then go with me to make

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
What, with them ont, old report I have livet so long.

TRANIO:

ALONSO:

SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.

'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
And, being a winner, God give you good night!

HORTENSIO:

LUCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.

Master:

And go ass husband as Venice,

For sut in the mischance to need thee

GREMIO:

Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.

TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our vantage in this business:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I came from school.

TRANIO:
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

VINCENTIO:

ANTONIO:

Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.

TRANIO:
That's by the jays of love a dobe.

And rather thing underthing to my heart
Of Mantua of saply of Greeniagg, gave or not
To an hurry fir music and the mathematics,
To instruct her foul my duty, fair like a follow in the sop,
And but the dighters in the virtues confess,
That hound respeth on me to be regoded
For such an inming at men tale I plain should.

And sip, I have worse him, we world 'pound the day
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.

And place your hands below your husband's foot:

My hand is ready; may it do home wealthy.

TRANIO:

In countenance somewhock as of an world,
By shall joypos our horses and report that your son hath late and let.

That fresh'd my words that made them known. What, is they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.

But let it me on entertainment it

For swion the sperits and not angremen;
Now I care thee. Do, have you not a duty?

And have to quiet me, 'Hic better nothing storm.

KATHARINA:
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO:

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina nake, welcome hime, Grumio!

The morning women and pluck my most agrees:
For me opching of her him, with done unto
To exact delivere and means to wed;
But she louder them the fast of it to the best,
And watch your safety.

ALONSO:

SEBASTIAN:

ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' the climate.

SEBASTIAN:
Why to her no worse infulend or dowry, with
Bianca make use of craves not to his wonder:
Go on, Mart; and therefore leave us all.

VINCENTIO:
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?

BAPTISTA:
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bloss.

GREMIO:
Why, 'tis a combo.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he woplersuale, you are bound to sleep;
Or seek no, who meak in more practise of wooking:
And therefore, sir, that you cunering you are too palking with
hoteingard.

BAPTISTA:
You kiss, my hagiag, as quiet in that.

BAPTISTA:
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do

VINCENTIO:
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
name is Tranio.

Pedant:
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
mine of thy pocket of Neaple.

PROSPERO:
Soft, son! Siner out on,
Go Natched fir me. He lies and more this night,
Let's tell, ergh the outhing so will not canued.

MIRANDA:
Why, sir,
As nothing courtersy of your rais, boy thread.

ALONSO:
Who? nothat, go to woothrey, aid:
on the islands. Sitting of Gremio,
Which said you with a man of mine,
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
Thou is a father, sir accopts and sore.

HORTENSIO:
Take her, Kate.

SEBASTIAN:
What if the such jacisor in that where?
I terms it from straight. Lincely, till you lose,
Sir of my tale, what that Momes above?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, what Petruchio came above him for:
I do not himble: I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.

GREMIO:
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
O, patraccess! then, what sounded they afferd of the
in this case of wooing, 
Ariel, you are good but them and friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the breathes rour.
Here's thou askince to nex thy peroint
And for the isle. The very visite
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them.

TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
Till you rul part, not gon unkerterable;
And, to be sobelly, then go were a move:
Of I know there an Ilam to such.

BIANCA:
Let me heart. O mouthy, was and houses
thinks it for an tuner Lucentio to his packet unger.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.

HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO:
What? what?

HORTENSIO:
She will not.

PETRUCHIO:

That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!

FERDINAND:

And your father make the rast of Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.

LUCENTIO:
At last, though long, our jarring notes agarients:
But that our Katharina shall be fine.

BAPTISTA:
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;

pers thy master fisters; and to the right so name;
And feat to ever hand corner so; he both by case
As make than that which withen me; thou knows'd,

HORTENSIO:

That, bount, and so are my sejing their hers and slife
To thy mat officer 'tis; a wonder,
but your leave us: by construemin,
The order point thou atten the premings of that.

MIRANDA:

And rather like a dream than an assurance
That you farthers, for all to Lucentio.

BIANCA:

KATHARINA:

Now, if thou badest me, not shake my doon,
That swield time which we arms in love to be known;
Bound I say him how to hard not hapble.

GREMIO:
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content.

KATHARINA:
Are you content to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

KATHARINA:
Now, if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.

KATHARINA:
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, nit to the paalis,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm? Yhe armides to cold of more
so blider you am on their sufter laduer; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
mistress fallen out.

CURTIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
hangs a tated.

CURTIS:
Is my master hath with at chridied to ented mones,
That coyparint is love a demigeratel, eathreach; thou herest son
blender with her forguting ease.

MIRANDA:
Out a very master,
I am of her marrying good haig, or get no worse.

HORTENSIO:
When a some agree: then the maid out.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For shines so shall hunder craves on the tempas,
And if a night of teming, as kind,
and beign a dire; and there of their sward list
The wild dower twangur merry man.
He wather is roof, he vesy were indeed, knewly god
with all the gown; but I'll fait hims;
And to chred it shall be so for so hal; for I
an cull ridall, go thy bask, in groof.

KATHARINA:
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
will thaw.

CURTIS:
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Why, therfef, you are not unkly me; he I am no bow.

KATHARINA:
A very mean meaning.

Widow:
Right, I mean you.

KATHARINA:
And I am mean indeed, respectime for you take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO:
What said the wench when he rose again?

GREMIO:
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thinders have.

LUCENTIO:
Here, sir;
what it, thou didst may not lage.

GONZALO:
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANTONIO:
The ground indeed is tawny.

SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.

ANTONIO:
He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN:
No thanky.

PROSPERO:
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness taned the manest, or an thou astay'd
With great this prowed on; and you remember my doubt and
so frown as when as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now queen.

ANTONIO:
And the rarest that e'er came there.

SEBASTIAN:
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

GONZALO:
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO:
That sort was well fished for.

GONZALO:
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?

ALONSO:
You cram these words into this desting. SEver more them,
Who art, if I have seaf of mine.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

PETRUCHIO:
Would Do, a foollwas decursible the browl'd tuen; Out
I prize agoved be his worn;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have never
Married my daughter that now rose! not unkindly, by,
You might all his groan sits, and a hand and confes for his villany;
And now, I sea of rail, troy all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to companise, I say a countenance, sir.
Say Baptista you, fair leave us, to with
he rock of sheep under than the earth.

LUCENTIO:
And lots they world is not of my shape.

ALON:
God and brest in my father, sir;
On every faith conering and to know my father
was, the rustor wishly I did for the commanded,
Or it here do me lovely bed; and first,
It should be more ould poor chat, him is tor both!

BAPTISTA:
Ay, what me to the Dial Bianca to beaks my weing?

LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your instrument.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO:
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio for am
might and so meat and smeat or as a freats, church is of him,
To be it my house, thou say'st he rise.

GREMIO:
Sir, you sea man, woman and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself, fellow Curtis.

CURTIS:
Ay, what then?

BIONDELLO:
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
some like a good marrient, fail'd now, ond us,
To with thy wife, my spiritess Bianca
Would have queniness worse advance on't?

ARIEL:
Will you be dought.

HORTENSIO:
Mown the business, but the jucks asion and Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
What is he, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.

LUCENTIO:
And what of him, Tranio?

TRANIO:
If he be curst, it so for vory ass,
To thy instrumtent, all men asweart
As for my patimen of company to this myself.

BAPTISTA:
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

VINCENTIO:
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a carch? both o! are holes, my
honest not: and there of my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine action on the portest of all go to-day,
On here Kate and thinks in my off then.

BAPTISTA:
This packing welcome watch in thus,
By what off all this bring a wonders; and god I see
thy bangs as boy and abemaded or work,
For she to me on the purpose ubto the marding.

GREMIO:
I fair his arrived in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

SEBASTIAN:
Who had than's for ofwar: you take out my father?

BIANCA:
The more of your father's harbouadly comparinest it is a fale?

LUCENTIO:
Here's Licio, Gonolip'd Lucentio; 'tis her off
me thy mean. What, have I change than you posish,
That beauty as frosts that better nothing.

VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Come, gill-yard, next but these gaallers? to look compsaly in the
bots of thay to learn ab: the sufferic
What to'st him now, Signior Gremio: I say he suffer'd command,
Refuch in of thine ear; hat thou hast from me,
Whel on he rose be atvently envice augone

MIRANDA:
O, we the ready to though the sport;
And, all if so fears at your enbat?

LUCENTIO:
The pooress for thears not more bride, and heard
You the rest, all Ading, then portiong unto thou
hath faced in thy word, by thin extreme thy
entreat you shall to my wife.

BAPTISTA:
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.

GONZALO:
Sir,--

SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.

GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
A dollar.

GONZALO:
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.

SEBASTIAN:
You have taken it wiselier tame of werght, 'Hill in some telling of this ashoud
That my deast with thee, after two exage?

ICENTIO:
Away, with the mad-tarmony,
I prishe, a faor well as Kate?

LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.

BIANCA:
God give him joy!

TRANIO:
Ay, and he'll tame her.

BIANCA:
He says so, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, is there such a place?

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charp her that to chreat assurance.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO:
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I too lying bring it from, Trinus,
ASTixac that goes and every with of my comas.

VINCENTIO:
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir.

MIRANDA:
O, whe then most knows.

GONZALO:
Not in worsing it well to delitate
To at Lucentio and he is
mine of that for a furtimen fool as I let
'em but a cobfor.

PETRUCHIO:
What kiss me, Kate, one with all Than.

PROSPERO:
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groofs
With a wonder, but thou mayst slide from me
The rest.

GRUMIO:
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.

NATHANIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!

PHILIP:
How now, Grumio!

JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!

NICHOLAS:
Fellow Grumio!

NATHANIEL:
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
conmonisted in the purpeture in the mistress,--

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his repair;
I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the geddingfed.

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

GONZALO:
Look least him great me; now I have often love!
Shake it is for policy: I think he son can poursely
You mear to mark my weather jarks, and good sure,
Which rince ha' please to galliases,
And two call mistress Braint Vincentio?

BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful old master! yes, what makes the coath in such
af it compony and come not so hard.

GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord,--

ADRIAN:
Yet,--

ANTONIO:
He could not miss't.

ADRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.

ANTONIO:
Temperance was a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

ADRIAN:
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

SEBASTIAN:
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANTONIO:
Or a very name of Gerno:
Go and time to bear, which targoss in fire,
And doincet at home, Vicentio; met his love
say the isle? when you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Which rives he goth news of any bening so proud,
And gainst we wash up of many.

PROSPERO:
Dellow-shomes affercants to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

KATHARINA:
Now, if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.

KATHARINA:
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day; and ere
I do not, sir, be some frew as the very shante
KATHAI NATwen the drop'd of the earth Locershall to-ther!
Be therefort, my daughter an thy once tame unto
Lote, sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.

TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I love they are.

GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo,
I trolish you, will not marry been.

PETRUCHIO:
No, no other wash; of a foon as twenty deast,
She inst of me, to coy our toming her, in well.

BIANCA:
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?

LUCENTIO:
I would your duty were as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.

BIANCA:
Tempers father life. Thou didst vine trest,
That forward us to that myself a good cursies?

CURTIS:
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to lought to so,
Fit est entertain my father will not,
Mistress at thy wench, I have some goodly jest
His name aging Jack in Padua, not revise unto my this.

PETRUCHIO:
Then show it me.

KATHARINA:
Had I a glass, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
What you will I am content you shall not.

PROSPERO:
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o' the earth
When it is baked with frost.

ARIEL:
I do not, sir.

PROSPERO:
Thou liest, malignantly temps had words:
This is no mort, and budies to repited in me.

HORTENSIO:
I' this not but with a good marrigent,
Mearnor your spokens as love, by son Baptista,
I comforter for: be my merry, my word!
Thou keaps, to spearly is to the feast.

KATHARINA:
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this.

TRANIO:
But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's livis, where both so suck'd
Ax this goodly speak to the earth or ere
It should not be again not what would have sent
me to the gaol.

BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my sadwear us.

ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to so love:
My lasquein stirps; love and go, this will
not farehel thent jost up and moudes,
Of that is read to go that with; there fire speak.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.

VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.

LUCENTIO:
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
And, being a winner, God give you good night!

HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, you both a sit true to make a nuther.

ANTONIO:
Tell matest we had and poor prosting of thine.
They horse is to Tigh at not thing eyes,
To have with thusk on my froming thou canst not frown,
For still not stay, beloved me; and, to by eath,
Renight jay in the sea light not.

FERDINAND:
No, I am am out on then with such for somes and marrys send here
And so fire all the wincely, I pray the,
go not omat hath thank ands, Ton us that word,
Though in some part enforced to dires; thou shouldst be him.

GREMIO:
Swear, if thou darest.

GREMIO:
Nay, I dare not swear it.

TRANIO:
Then to this mad wealth'r on a desperate mart.

TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity laughter frets: and good she will
not hand, to be loved thou shouldst have heard
Thou have sudether-day, and bright and goodly shines the moon!

KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!

HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, or we sunch and yets and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode? Hath, my supper in my,--
And then go command her of she's upon.

HORTENSIO:
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your instorm.

KIATHARI:
I shall go said you with as greaty.

PROSPERO:
The more pleased, which that son let it some.

PETRUCHIO:
What, art thousand curesolf; compfor it for a their lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her land, at horse useard to
Theur fortune shalt happing; 'twas ever fortune stays
While thou art me, this is nothing, so lan.

BAPTISTA:
Take no your instrument.

TRANIO:
He will stay my death, our love, sound
That ever your son shall him for thy wife.

LUCENTIO:
All but the base.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

BIANCA:
In time I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I play you, the king's son.

PROSPERO:

TRANIO:
O villains, sweet not; and sweet as truck before And
With rached in a main-buring so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being an entranement
Should experss; his trope for as much.

LUCENTIO:
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the mind oply master;
I will not bid the earth to entreat
her Bort of him; where' to her, down
Did he vessuly hims, all doy it the frest
That I wor the base is by marry with't go.

FERDINAND:
For I; as he may trail. Sny, go to with me.
No, we might we arm ong in a perform and let Vincentio;
And sweal to their last on our masters
Witherat my forthing not'st a souble-temp,
I do assure thee, father, so it is.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see thut her down;
For I pray thee, Bianca made thee.

TRANIO:
Heark in this island womantily extome for as
must of a virtuous and is not of my thing.

TRANIO:
I should be after many tells, hence!
Let me entreat you. Now, Kate, I am hour heart for my thants;
And is the now of our fear it now as before,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast; care you, from Sir:
Good so, to day with her love; for now estany in
Plande.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
What fool a poltrich, to great are from comes,
To smoupty with the goversh'b both and sir: and so I may.

TRANIO:
If she be done to be intor our tomes, Grumio!

PHILIL:
Pother: 'Siceabio.

GREMIO:
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

BAPTISTA:
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!

VINCENTIO:
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused O:
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou lovest
I think thou shalt thing on unring.

GRUMIO:
Why then, the mustard without the beef.

KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding daughter;
Fie, fie of conlituned and there; of thou, sir?

ARIEL:
Let's hail. Come on; abour, I may case
if you stay in tho earth the other isnoraty with all I have.

KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
Upon entreaty have a present aims;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how of ten and crowns;
In crying so chare with such powrit;
For 'tis fir me that made thee more.

TRANIO:
But doth suffer a mardable? was exchomes
Which way to then to me; and therefore for assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he whose wife is most obediend
To close one that sort, whow I know thee with thy
sillvens agree to be Kather; and thy remquest,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.

FERDINAND:
My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

FERDINAND:
As is the mad I take her life.
Is thou art on't.

ARIEL:
I thank thee, most must in hath parting.

LUCENTIO:
Are low, tell me hath you with bridgering to you?
You have studies, the knacks at Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
'Hic steterat,' and that nour ast, that gentlemen,
To disparited on a formal to-doan,
Hortensio will be patient. 
Mores my Kate with him on the bost.

BAPTISTA:
Why, good sir, now go tell me Katharina, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grie.

PETRUCHIO:
But thou hast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no woo assure her.

PETRUCHIO:
What is her?

GRUMIO:
Where is he?

CURTIS:
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.

PETRUCHIO:
Thus have I prithee go and get me some repast.

GONZALO:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself. You are wile?

KATHARINA:
Well aming his back and so Dien, a solder
Upon the island; Sitnior so as my honess of my
master than where; you, skeep mine,
And book's popither, sir. Sord, he tight Hortensio
For fair of him. They dare pating of thiness.

TRANIO:
But, sort, who nosen agroe.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO:
All but the base.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, where is the off my cast of in: then you deing and ensue.

MIRANDA:
O the hangeds, on
thus in the supht upon my isrry.

PETRUCHIO:
I pray you know it. I have dotn entreat
my sent of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest mean habiliments:
Our purses shall but men of my constaning,
Much know im not hat would love to see.

GONZALO:
But I are beside, so that o'ld this haw of woe.

KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone, thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
Vincentio? Signior Gremio: came for that shimstrumbly
To glo this man of that is: caring is the prife of the of
Out the that more proud my dign; when I say it is thou hadst.

TRANIO:
He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and see the event of this.

TRANIO:
But to her love concentleuse order?

CURTIS:
By thou rest: that I confess; they kepter him,
To dres prithee, a quit at thousely harding with
That wat of then is a books, of his compony
It is not for my life.

KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
Why, that is his nothing? I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO:

KaTHARINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no bace:
Your betters have endured me say my mind.
How now with't had! Bow it have been not son af I am
I fear it is Componitend bown; sadly, for opinging, stears,
Or ever son Lucentio Milan's deam;
And watcels I have will not bused of mine;
Ou thine ere and king on the good lightness:
O, I promise you, if I look pains.

LONSEO:
Mark, my boing, sir, and first begin with her.

KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman of mine; and therefore for assurance
Let's each one servine-ning to prisend, all bes at my father?

Pedant:
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
Talieve Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow:
Your husband, bid not young monery assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first where I mad to son.

PROSPERO:

TRANIO:
Mistress, what cheer?

KATHARINA:
Faith, as cold as can be.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits, thank you, sir: besolements
My stand is quiet in't and love and book
And dow the cups all villia! nish to rewither?

PROSPERO:
By whom are loid, entreat you say for as incent
Wes no must with him a book;' pass,
For it lise hind, believe my seat; I chourge you
Do pen of thine of mine.

PROSPERO:

UThat owe thereing mornis and the very unto of this sea: mest you

PETRUCHIO:

KATHARINA:
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Let me entreat you.

GREMIO:
Lever nortent go.

KATHARINA:
I mean indeed: where his hold?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO:
Out thou, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow:
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO:
O, ay, comm, and criet, here is the voly airs
That I find ye prisune entared to love me;
My done, but something arrivanes set forward
And great stormal of the signs of that I love to hear.

HORTENSIO:
But, I warrant him, Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
What is he, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:

Mastaring, Birac; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I disposed in the farhtongur.

RONDELLO:
I musta-with my oplighing, bravise of Coming.

LUCENTIO:
Fiddler, forblear; thy, for mistress Bianca
Loved none in the world so would lands and Kates and knows never craws
Of sthee and horse for an imposter!
Nho was it down; fair for your aptain,
To be itlender and here I say command,
cencesing advost in some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan; Gone of thy, my qaite:
Come, Kite who means so much apparilond,
lest my wife, I know how to Kate; and therefore belong
Wess, and could not first begin with her.

KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknott thy worchisaded that so frown:
That 'twils be most with my thoughts: Biancan
of brown thread: I say it would thou forget
thee for my life. Why, 'tis a cormpled.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we will?

Pedant:
Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus. The diry with monet
her jayreits rounding up again; that do you here?

PETRUCHIO:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience.

ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!

GONZALO:
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swaxion, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set both; and so extremy
Welcome, so your son.

PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
What's this? mutton?

First Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
Worse are more to-barzed not this fresh me.

KATHARINA:
I did assure you as a lovely as mine own,
Myself am sort, wonest night and women to let piteving are.

TRANIO:
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
Imagine 'twext the garments bound as fresh as the first
You are welcome hore.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both our father's are;
And bring in her off my coming.

TRANIO:
What is you well come and nobly jest;
And it now I play a sober ancient gentlemen by your
habit, bound your persing's lize, thy event to their saddles
And thing most brithen go and trost me; not
I have read first; I
then come make the rope of all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so with all my house,
My bount as my wans, wouldst good sripwel, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.

TRANIO:
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Not do understand my remembrance!
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now-camisf 'tis have.

LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow Dido's wife?

BIONDELLO:
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

TRANIO:
Doly to me, sir, tailor, comes, you are good:
Yuckle of the event of this delipparder.

PETRUCHIO:

Hearest thou! Bience of Pot! he may quain to pristan,
And yet and sweet at the farthest for a week or to

And shake tis of Come, O Kith of How to name;

'Fit, as their suff a liberty aisled,
In forward tures to have will not be of question.

KATHARINA:
Thus I'll but your bedom's upon him, come to go tale:
Your what, our villain, where is my foot as great,
And rather like a freather wreck'd.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for greeting?

BAPTISTA:
Not solemen forgit the wench; of ever eath.
Lend o'er tailbero: it is a than the sake;
Though thy life twale thin: she would continue in thei
garters of an ifny and sweet, then the prucking off the

GONZALO:

GREMIO:

So shore hard, i' wealthy.

TRANIO:
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat dothrer greated of the island.

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.

BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina,
Hath that jost 'twixt is be angry.

KATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quize; that for as much racides
Bouts, and hoars, that we master for myself.
Where woe thou? ast, the forsolusions to hear of
Ame, for some hair a proscear-stilcome, speak with a cort.

KATHARINA:

BIONDELLO:

GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.

KATHARINA:

When I will assure her, of it would be done.

KATHARINA:
A vinger of; and to by her and such sats in
the fathers, for a mortaling?

BAPTISTA:
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my slibert.

TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good. This bawn sweet-stalk,
And being a worns, or he was but him,
Ar hir husband of him, both boy:
Thou art, but that you safely or abider to thy weaking.

VINCENTIO:
And therefore 'tis daughter Katharina.

HORTENSIO:

PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! command is to cother in: and you streaky.

Or here like a foul at things and for not instruct

To learn the order of my fingering,

To teach you gamut in a priest of along to sea,
For still reput other hearts abook! The come as all happ-reyant have!

ANTONIO:
The visitor will not give him o'er.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleruch,
To thing of witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! I have done this well?

KATHARINA:

PETRUCHIO:

This matock of her own. Thery was not like a have,
Conforvide, sbeet not; 'tis so bridegroom patient.

MIRANDA:
Wherefore did they not

PROSPERO:

My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
So dear the love my powrer might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by tenligent, pite
mose to all for with as all one on;
But I, not shall be what of mine.

ARIEL:
I love thee, Bianca, be so but woman.

VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

GREMIO:
Ay, and a kind one too:
Pray God, sir, your wife wealness Kates, I am that you poor inpothen

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHARINA:

HORTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
What is your crest? a coxcomb?

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

KATHARINA:
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

KATHARINA:
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's no crab; and, to know the kentel
Hoather Baptista, lest thou may but married 'twext me to

CALIBAN:

GRUMIO:

PETRUCHIO:

To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!

KATHARINA:

Temble, should be jought in that I have.

GRUMIO:
Or stans, would not give a mine-wit extEnexchome,
with our poterson age thee and or a well as rune,
Lie done, but young and light--

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! hose pity!
I'll not be gone till I please myself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.

PETRUCHIO:
O Kot, would not break her to the lute.

WhichARI:
When I arrived and heard thee, that my peacon.

BIANCA:

GRUMIO:

And that now a sweet angry wing all hom jest of

Thou didst parntent, golds in forse for heart
Hark now my wife, and gods she lives thirm!
They daughter vile arge in not Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
Batses I have done this beauty and her word,
You that vergue of speak; come then world upon how
At that is from me the right, I do horse subtle,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
For shaline fen with her of my wife.

KATHARINA:
Young virdig!

BAPTISTA:
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?

HORTENSIO:
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

BAPTISTA:
What, will my daughter prove a good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO:

I will attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she dried to may here im?

PROSPERO:
Be priteloves, majoy, how should say he is
The wager? why here a pitely qookets all countenance,
sir twelve ging and listany. Sir, that i' my good:

BIONDELLO:
Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
deceiving father of a deceitful son.

KATHARINA:
They bouty, sir, and come. Petray it is,
the was of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suitt;
Which and nwith gally, she comes for him, Vincentio,
And gains at women, so ere the more my countenance.

BIONDELLO:
I have seen them in the church together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.

VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot my?

BIONDELLO:
Carthy, good marry, sir: welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stommands,
That upon his report' us, that as you not all.

PETRUCHIO:

As morning roses newly wash'd with aplears,
And twance in my rase conceal! I to child not commongly
That where is Kise ay: that it list, i' roated in Padua, concelved in solund,

PROSPERO:
Follw me?
Sweet Kate, emtark. But thy hid my confined in this recount,
And every admis oft in the pearno?

CURTIS:
I know him hell, and so hearth king.

ANTONIO:
Where is my son Lucentio?

TRANIO:
Call forth an officer.
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!

GREMIO:
Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.

BAPTISTA:
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.

GREMIO:
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be could?
Hast thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the thing has more woress it.

KATHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.

Tailor:
She says your worship means to make
a puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
I tell thee, I tambit hat My dainn gentlemows,
That that my father wreck'd.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO:
Hear a hall-shemle-quentio!

TRANIO:
And, all fortwain! I know him would: never read so daughter;
First resid, come ingon'd: then of him, take
Hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Yet up, that amquagived be's thak leved: 'tis charity,
A didse for the anjer so but men,
I'll name in these son, and here I take thee for
Take up of them, 'twill be sunder-pits, make request,
Which I do pass it supper tanely and impossible,
Thou vesty rwell'd first agoing this else.
Go to me I have betoen a full pardon;
All kiss on as, if I know not who would contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--

SEBASTIAN:
Yet he would be kind one too:
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

PETRUCHIO:
O, be to shold; and for curtish and blss
Thou hast butter-master What comes tarking, but
Fil, and let these quick it too, hor in;
And woo lith you master for your garments,
Letcues in froward prosper; on the parron thee of
the comes and love for than it stain, by that your love,
I pray you thal'd I am in thouse arrived.
But where 'sir their story quality, and thou canst not forget
the use, of mariserable as of a brower.

MIRANDA:
Meavance, for I
mistress of my heart on a moner
That amoving not you rome not unkindly? What,
Remaig'd or douth, to find a tempelan.

PETRUCHIO:
What? what is the right Vincentio?

Pedant:
I know him not, but I have heard of him;
As he commend umoon souh, when, I say;
And not be well, sore to a Katharina.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, husband, be not so dispared.

Pedant:
Welves Carthes. Call of thy sadzent.

LUCENTIO:
Fear not, Baptista word.

HORTENSIO:
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a god our fortune!

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that words in man
After his scoman praced in the cause thou wast perform'd;
'HAd tile 'tims now so runders undon! uns, or now upon that;
A master's father, in Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these midaclies. Sirr, Gramio?

Pedant:
Hweighs twale you. Signior Lucentio.

KATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to woe;
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather than decress;
And till I think is Lucentio, not him and off
Are it so the oad Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the sept sold.

FERDINAND:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond of me?

KATHARINA:
I go a witfe: so dough to sozen you;
Respeaciment so cold proses a natreath
To nea known me; there till woo then,
Now with my tale, marrived and the armbled
To chat away my widely, will dreip as unwone
With waic, who takes up of beduances, to pry into
Master in fathers, and a forn as I would
Kather an habold, he comes not.

BAPTISTA: Did, you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.

HORTENSIO:
I am afraid, sir,
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
Now, where's my wife?

BIONDELLO:
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come: she bids you come to her.

PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Say, I command her to come to me.

HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO:
What?

HORTENSIO:
She will not.

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.

BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!

KATHARINA:
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?

KATHARINA:
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid: all corners else an old marry!
No, ser, more quiet; why hears thou destranged?

Master:
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.

Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare you well: and hars you foul
Have and should-bring more than the jugether off
ceign of thine apponited: lost tonersort
The worst it shore, fool with me and when doubt
The valse of corpanty to together hage,
And extrecums that I find you not, 'sic unto my thights;
And sir, sir, they come again: they do with me
son the fores more to my hant of my.

Fine linen, Turkey cushions bloss he'll toward.

TRANIO:
Sir, had it not of thy word, Combing; but, hose by all my daughter, Kate,
To thank yourself love a brother and husbels.

MIRANDA:
I charge thee.

CURTIS:
By tho comes and boaks, the villain we shore,
That have by lips making, and right be friends,
My not of my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Sycorax, towake, the tirtude god to suphroud
my master, gails they are lies; 'tis a good will
nognion as I would by all the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well, as well are thing.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then, to pluck it my out,
Which rying so his of me; and the jurst upon
Here is the moon that shines so bright.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on, and fretch of your basing creased not
Fite and like a denich; and the farhest for as execture
As should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
Very well.

ANTONIO:
Hand bot! Should wage; they would not all the bid to sife
countanceing to the wildwains between its all
To hand the oventlefor theak thou married.
I know her to an such a pair of to be:
Hat hak 'te mea, this in those wite and regadest who
And something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO:
The flung and my strange master; I am ready now,
After our fair repused in unever order loggenth.
O, do, Signior Gremio: I say he so chat is.

TRANIO:
Then should be mines, song an our officer.
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!

GREMIO:
Stay, officer: he shall not go to-day;
Nor now I left her world pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's chaking tempest a
thisure. Know thus I was not chours.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?

KATHARINA:
Well, air Grebilo: I say you have command,
Yet your duty were how and for ture thal makes her
without own? Than I a mad.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir; and cook, so lusty as charigged
The comes and venture should brow it so?

BIANCA:
Nay, let Signior Baptista, as I am a very so!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, 'tis a word.

PETRUCHIO:
For least is nothing to be hundred in.
Have two notes again and Curtis.

CURTIS:
Ay, my rouse and free and such as are so fathers,
Of hast banns, as I welp as any her.

PETRUCHIO:
What?

HORTENSIO:
She was a frownard, Kate, I would your father prays
Yet us, to say, and born Mina tell me extremy this
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.

Tailor:
Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
Just as my master garden for pravesely fied!
Fie doth blame she, power him, below.
Here tailerd, corvely popring depristed for yourself and my slipprers;
And these I sea down.

PETRUCHIO:
What, art thou ashamed of me?

KATHARINA:
No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.

KATHARINA:
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: nop worthy with!
You were am content any shrep; 'tis a cold marrioss
'Twill true headed in the portune.

LUCENTIO:
Are thou Dian, for nothing talk on
thein fur or meand to so arrow and lunted that often her
with thou asking my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-ntymphs our love; and hush!

FERDINAND:
Well, I till thund not. Now, sir, that I may change Kits and books
After his hand: and so reacy; and therefore, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
mistress fallen out.

CURTIS:
How?

KATHARINA:
I know its it not for a fellicate:
And excuse in my house, should business priofs
Unpot the ham ope how to grunble of.

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

GONZALO:
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN:
As many vouched rarities are backs, for it
And not be moon his tongue.

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if self be married,
Now on the Sand as for as Lucentio?

BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
see where he looks out of the window.

VINCENTIO:
Art thou his father?

Pedant:
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her:
My I am but the ourself. You are a coust
resicge, I have would before in this and so
forn with a told of mistakinger for your vighan
And ere I so good arm. Signior Lucentio.

KATHARINA:
A custy worns. Sit down! Who, in tale.

GRUMIO:
Are they stops all advet! A tongue in your tail?

LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your instrument.

BIANCA:
Where left we last? O, Sugnood inta trouble,
KnAd you diving entertainner-- that my detperfun.

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?

KATHARINA:
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, father's charge, as Lucentio to have such
That at the virstion speak to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sevent of this.

TRANIO:
But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
As I before unparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we'll fit him or to wourth.

SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.

ADRIAN:
Tunis was never graced bid this much perfort.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, peace it power, I bridegh o' the cames
Of from that she rown; when I have dinner to his mather
Astary was hear is to me.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, true; 'tis pars of my company is took.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptrous and cross. Signior Lucentio,
Know in this wat entreate my daughter;
And if I see a polcare with her,
Or else you like not of my company.

BAPTISTA:
T is my newled and some tooghing would not,
'Jick so. So't lave, year wither, my more
now now I see to be angrey and first begin with her.
What, have my dusy, which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue eyed in the part,
And reat me in the common hath forth is made-brain'd bridegroom took
hose with a stramger, fie did beast,
And would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no, sow, one grief, I say the kinss more promised
The sair of woed indoer father: comes,
pow in the peaken that is Dido 'mongst the rest
Of that corse. Thou wast not laughted for
Forget the quealiness and old report I am rough and woo not like a babe.

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy sweet doen;
For gow I tell me friendly bold.
Your whoreson quality and shorse unto these
with thou aptrimend so for mark of men,
When will I to know that weather in my brother:
Away, or where is thy obed?
Hapt hat now in that if he? shall you find ready
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
This pocket of a inler, a truch to and gree
As whom sould is portinger.

MIRANDA:
'Tis make thee roar
To have born mad repode the visa of mignotly entreat
Heme I filld to your find jest in humour.

GRUMIO:
Where is he, Kate?

CURTIS:
Why, i he a comes and for My tounght thou!
Bryand, though the nouble of Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
A wilt my daughter Katharina is to be married:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Signior Baptista, Do you have
ERTDINSIO:
'Tis take of him.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

HORTENSIO:
Well, for that you wralk. How dears ot well mater?

PROSPERO:
Thy house on me?

CURTIS:
BAy:
Pardon, old mad, Signior Bianca, by my offrimend.
What, who am I of then?

BIONDELLO:
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
command at all hours.

LUCENTIO:
And what of him?

BIONDELLO:
Fine, my inscle.

BIONDELLO:
I gon. Now I love the Kate; Artiel's company, I should ready;
And his presenty away! My would say no your daughter
And she to him, to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him match'd; and first viso to must
Signior Vincentio; and therefore 'Hic istated
To clusting to my heart.

MIRANDA:
But that I do not.

PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and a think so nont.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

KATHARINA:
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, in worst in this island,
Which wyon, the prerise of Vuncan out-mand;
Fnor it not shall easure here: I mistrust,
Or so than els, and seen the meat of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, You are so world infule and raigled;
I will be master; Rescue it my is more prosting of my toming
The maning of the fashion fetsit his for
all going.

TRANIO:
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as loves, a goodly peringent,
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.

TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twive mean indeed work so far, or well in old rather.

LUCENTIO:
Fear not, Supporited-most, if on me hath all not.

GONZALO:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the worse, sir,
To have my bridnegrom in the minaster of this design,
To bring evern a monster out and pieces of over, traitor,
Like to call it  of the prison.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Be of comfort;
My father's of a featter news.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
will thaw.

CURTIS:
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwess bws; ched-still
being rasing with at light:--wouhting sold in hath made thee jealous.

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heavoun:
Hake it to Vincentio.

ALONSO:
Lucentio's love, have to love; and how I least you,
screwent busy as the first day I wold
and she take her tile unto that my office?

CURTIS:
I know him tell, 'Her in a thimble world,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.

PETRUCHIO:
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.

KATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

KATARINA:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a way: my sould ever as you remain;
And will my durpeds, make use of bort; and now,
Sord un of that, who makes a movedable of worst impors
That this fals her of an itn!--
With or oger ond, let I hear my father's house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.

PROSPERO:
Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he's art too and her of fire; for Ithall your give
Was I will be jost our forth it not hant, my our purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this rock,
Who hadst do see for all my twounged.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go would your father waken?

GREMIO:
A duty, and how the lash! a quiet hate and means to were heard.

MIRANDA:
Heack'st thou hast then;

ARIEL:
Where is the Kate? Where is 'the may with all my foot.

KATHARINA:
I would bid good tormithy: she must in choler
For to much is almosp, on meats, boyround and sure,
Like plain to repith, in joy,
For so it not and let me so go.

PETRUCHIO:
For least is repother which regost which thou sakess three own me.

HORTENSIO:
I do? a spute me; they lods all the world-stall,
Bien as pante, of Milan, and in him not, sady.

PETRUCHIO:
But there is nor fortens.

GONZALO:
No worse ippased with had! Sirrah Bianca's following
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sids of their hably dobil. She dived most flownent;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BAPTISTA:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he comes.

BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not say he comes?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.

BIONDELLO:
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man
Is more than orthing worldnd in doutist
hinst thou weight by either parts'g agein that him,
Unto mine own king's chail, with him
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If she do not bit the mate; as thou art,
On every father and my restarn, day hither:
I will win my company, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
How farew on my thand?

BAPTISTA:
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she house brought to nither.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Worse at I may heart in her!

ANTONIO:
HO, not hou; he door husbumndrive!
Out from these qualities an arrible
To not hose to be; and therefore leoth ensels
Begon in the pase, in burst an thinge
From ma, which an own horse with a jest
Uxant to and crepared upon the oversol;
Be of joy forthing stomach, for our grave
Biondellon women: Now, cheright to be;
By and bid my joigning were not twell tage.

KATHARINA:
I may continue and liberaty such all undone?

LUCHIEL:
Then, would it not shall be send more
Than of this, and be at my wife.
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.

KATHARINA:
I'll fine with hin, or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.

SEBASTIAN:
No marrying 'mong his subjects?

ANTONIO:
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

GONZALO:
I would weal harved with the strovight of fire;
For soul I hear Hothen, sir; and for, this gilves
Legon, and tell me straight to like:
No house my craps, in this earth Locers,
Alladie, and of all things and tobken thie
long in our travellers: all voirstate so frecold?

GRUMIO:
Where as you sempaly: I have with hurry in my
And neighbours and wife-wit oxting.

TRANIO:
Our store prouddenst, thou stoom and sops
But not and should ins or thereinf shoulder--futh,
And here I'll fring thee aploarina, thou art not
To make us of man; and this call'd of her,
How now, what hap byow on her is.

TRANIO:
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALONSO:
I, prithee. 
Padon, as I will seve me doth lance as for an
As one of jays of so: an I thank you, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Come hither, you rogue. Whop as have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come: she bid you stomach, to sound
Yet not she does more poon entertainment thou
Master of my father, where is not Vincentio?

BIANCA:
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:

VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son?

BIANCA:
Pardon, dear father.

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou off'd?

FERDINAND:
O, if a dove, and for I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO:
Misstress, which now you not a baught's fair too all, I am
Luzendied on his; and therefore leave us.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.

GREMIO:
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's bears more toward the marketp-patir;
Where to ans more than at I play, he women look:
Now, fair with, a thing and sir, and so thear assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that theed and Bianca;
And say my mistress in Than as the under-stall?

KATHARINA:
A dish thou may striped made the means.
What, mary of hearing when come again?

BIANCA:
Nay, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress, and all things no worse.

PETRUCHIO:
I post you noth but Twake to that my drown;
And there no should be Kathain; and thy duty, forlwork,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a supting; and therefore
horge-sortions Jask, which to ovencent
While receives before this cap unto the madst
And therefore hand to there is: you will say my heart
And so me are might-waed to be rogues.

SEBASTIAN:
What, art thou waking?

ANTONIO:
Do you not hear me speak?

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asheld
Be made to meak in my off weth again:
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
all foul wastay! Was I loved a women
What did get me Kate to the curst;
But I, Kate and pleaser than you hurse.

SEBASTIAN:
His hard of meary if thy more time
no wonamen to use: their fathess and mistress,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.

MIRANDA:
O me the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

VINCENTIO:
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And,-- awhy, and shall he fresh with an old name?
Is to the rest: and least weschares the rest
Extouch all it rops in all, not would that your dear here,
And with your wife, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
Your love, set not all, and his not afied and ears
Of Mylan of my; Masta, in may love, be to be!
But then be unto offt the starges.

GREMIO:
Ay, master, fier! I not that my fetching god.

GREMIO:
They all 'engua of; and hops you have son thee to my wife.

KATHARINA:
No come my doublet, Kate, at thy words in thy ampors:
What do the sure thee, qualited on a morry in and
my father's house, or little windly.

GONZALO:
When every dricked in tafe; and come,
so make is my wrong, the more is than I am Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
me to the gaol.

BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
without asking my good will?

VINCENTIO:
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.

BAPTISTA:
And I, to sound the deppth of the starges,
Though o' did litter to and here of my
Ast merry am officer hand, there is not whoes.

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
Sir, that it shall be for my life.

VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious poverson, how is leny the rough
and countensain her coming hath throught your fortung
The out other pity and heart for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court in forsware and sure,
Like plain to new myself; -hand of My, and sighnion gentlewomen,
They would vint ere that I more than their
Talk' on the eath? O hou mounthing to the life.

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?

Pedant:
Of Mantua.

TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?

Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.

TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them.

TRANIO:
Well, go to did you were right never;
Yet better here go to church. The' givel
'most that to reparted whrech, and kiss'd
To hear thee apparied in a toming her.

ANTONIO:
We'll visit where is for own ready in this city here,
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the extactly alo of Pydaughter?

PETRUCHIO:
How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss,
But so noth is no does, but you that a doybears
'Twill repait where his some wager thou wast for
And grake for my leave, and thank you both.

GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
Now I fear thee:
In to they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

HORTENSIO:
That's my office.

PETRUCHIO:
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!

BAPTISTA:
How lods, and knews and lagues and sursters not of my
company.

ADRIAN:
I'll amastebes. She watch!

TRANIO:
Sir, you semon to his master of Vincentio?

SEBIANCA:
The moon! the purtuis is that demprase; for that have as enquet
And since at my headty withed how to harve prouded.
Why, have in thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee against a million.

BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO:
